Hello World!
My name is Masturoh Al-Ameen.
I am excited to be here!
I hope to achieve a great feat in this program. I look forward to becoming one of the best students in this Codecamp.
I also hope I will be able to influence many lives by creating solutions to challenges. I also look forward to getting a well paid job afterwards as a Fullstack Developer.
I also hope this program will enhance my knowledge of other programming languages especially python.
